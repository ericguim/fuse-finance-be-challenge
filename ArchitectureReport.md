# Architecture Report

## Overview

This service implements a stock trading platform using NestJS, following a layered architecture pattern with emphasis on separation of concerns and maintainability.
I assumed that the failed transactions shouldn't be retried at first, but I've suggested adding a retry mechanism in the future, in case the user didn't replace the order with the proper price.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Framework Selection

- **NestJS**: Chosen for its structured architecture, dependency injection, and TypeScript support
- **Prisma**: Selected as ORM for type-safe database operations and schema management

### 2. Layer Separation

The application follows a three-layer architecture:

- **Presentation Layer** (Controllers): Handle HTTP requests/responses
- **Business Layer** (Services): Implement business logic
- **Data Layer** (Repositories): Handle data persistence

### 3. Design Patterns Used

- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts database operations
- **Dependency Injection**: Enables loose coupling and testability
- **DTO Pattern**: Ensures data validation and transformation
- **Observer Pattern**: Used in email notifications and event handling

### 4. Data Management

- **Caching Strategy**: In-memory cache for stock data
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliable data storage
- **Schema Management**: Prisma migrations

### 5. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Jest for isolated component testing
- **Mocking**: External dependencies mocked for reliable tests
- **Coverage**: Focused on business logic components

### 6. Key Features Implementation

#### Stock Trading

- Real-time stock data caching
- Transaction processing
- Portfolio management

#### Reporting System

- Daily transaction aggregation
- Email notification service
- Scheduled report generation

#### User Management

- Basic CRUD operations
- Portfolio tracking
- Transaction history

### 7. Error Handling & Validation

- Global exception filter
- DTO-based input validation
- HTTP status code standardization

### 8. Current Limitations

- No proper domain modeling
- Limited business rules encapsulation
- Tight coupling to database schema

## Potential Improvements

### 1. Move Towards Clean Architecture

- Implement proper domain entities
- Add use case layer
- Separate domain logic from infrastructure

### 2. Apply DDD Principles

- Identify bounded contexts
- Implement aggregates and value objects
- Add domain events

### 3. Technical Improvements

- Add integration tests
- Implement proper CQRS
- Add event sourcing
- Improve error handling
- Add proper logging system
- Consider adding a retry mechanism for failed transactions

### 4. Security Enhancements

- Add authentication/authorization
- Implement rate limiting
- Add API versioning
- Improve input validation

### 5. Scalability

- Add message queue
- Implement proper caching strategy
- Consider microservices approach
